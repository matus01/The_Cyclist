# The Cyclist

![Simulation Preview](assets/Final_4k_Image_Overview.png)
## Overview
**The Cyclist** is a crowd simulation project focused on modeling interactions between cyclists and pedestrians in an urban environment. Developed using Unity, this simulation leverages **NavMesh pathfinding** and **Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles (RVO)** for realistic movement and collision avoidance. 

The goal is to simulate real-life traffic behavior, particularly:
- **Collision avoidance** between pedestrians and cyclists
- **Priority control** at intersections and crosswalks
- **Realistic movement dynamics** using waypoints and behavior modeling

## Features
- **Top-down 3D simulation**
- **Dynamic pedestrian and bicycle movement**
- **Waypoint-based navigation system**
- **NavMesh with dual surfaces for pedestrians and cyclists**
- **Collision avoidance using RVO (Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles)**
- **Priority-based interaction at intersections and crosswalks**
- **Cyclists maintain right-side riding behavior**
- **Overtaking mechanism for cyclists**
